This package sort of build-depend on itself. 

It is safe to build it without having itself installed (and that's good for
the autobuilders), but if you plan to hack on quilt, you'd better install
quilt so that your changes get properly saved in debian/quilt/patches.

Then, to hack happily around, just export QUILT_PATCHES=debian/patches
