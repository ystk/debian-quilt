quilt (0.63-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release
    - drop the patches accepted upstream: return2, diff_exit_code,
      patch-wrapper_do_depend_on_proc, unset_grep_options
      
  * Update and simplify our patches to ease their adoption upstream
    - reorder the patches: put the ones accepted upstream below
    - drop d/p/select-mail: was not functional, actually, and the
      patch selection mechanism introduced upstream deprecates this.
  * d/control: Update to standard version 3.9.5 (no change needed)
  * d/rules: Add stage1 DEB_BUILD_PROFILE, not building the docs to
    cut the dependency on lynx and hevea (Closes: #738114)

  * New upstream release. 
    - Update our patches against this new release; drop accepted ones:
      doc_search_of_patches, default_pager_less-R,
      handling_of_patches_with_column_in_their_name
    - Rename d/p/fix-test-setup to d/p/setup-dont-read-pc: upstream
      setup don't work when our .pc directory changes QUILT_PATCHES to 
      debian/patches. We used to have a little hacky solution, but
      it's not enough anymore, so make it right.

    timeskew while building the packages (and Closes: #466360).
  * debian/deb3: Remove QUILT_PATCH_OPTS=--reject-format=unified as it

  * debian/control: specify the encoding to emacs at the file bottom,
    not the file top (Closes: #689554).
    This should help clumsy tools that get fooled when the control
    file begins with an empty paragraph, even if they should not break.
  * debian/control: Recommends less, as we use it in most commands
    (probably all but the raw push/pop ones). (LP: #1089601)
  * Add deb3 script to convert debian source package to new 3.0
    (quilt) format. Thanks to Osamu Aoki for that (Closes: #581186).
  * d/p/dep3mail: Allow mail subcommand to get the mail subject
    from dep3-formated patches, so that I can use it to report
    the changes done to quilt itself to my own upstream.
  * d/p/doc_search_of_patches: Document the fact that quilt searches
    for its `patches' directory in the same way that git searches for
    its configuration (Closes: #549482).
  * d/p/doc_exit_status: Document the exit status (Closes: #587001).

    patches directory documented in quilt(1). Closes: #585438

  * Drop entirely debian/patches/testsuite_cleanups since it's no longer
    needed.
  * Integrate 2 small regression fixes from upstream in

  * Drop patch po-fix-msguniq which added an invocation to msguniq to
    the po files regeneration. Nothing similar is done in the packages
    I checked, and msgmerge seem to be reasonable nowadays.
  * add configure option --with-awk=/usr/bin/awk to avoid that
    configure finds locally installed gawk (don't explicit dependent
    on awk since it's essential)                          Closes: #637014

  * Refresh all other patches.
  * Disable patch debian/patches/testsuite_cleanups as it creates more
    problems than it seems to solve.
  * Drop lintian override file, the only override needed has been fixed
    upstream (by dropping the useless shebang).
  * Add missing ${perl:Depends} to the Depends field.
  * Switch to debhelper compat level 8.
  * Switch away from CDBS to dh.
  * Ensure we can build twice in a row by resetting properly the
    regenerated po/*.{po,pot} files.

  * Update documentation of dh_quilt_{,un}patch to use the
    correct dh command-line syntax (thanks to Michael Ole Olsen for the
    report!) and add a note saying that those tools are useless with the "3.0
    (quilt)" source format.
  * Add "Multi-Arch: foreign" so that packages of foreign architectures can
    depend on quilt. Closes: #640784
  * Update Standards-Version to 3.9.2 (no changes required).
  * Update lintian override to match the new output.

  * Update watch file to not hardcode a specific savannah mirror.
  * Add a lintian overrides for script-not-executable
    ./usr/share/quilt/scripts/patchfns, it's a shell library with a
    useless shebang.
  * Update debian/patches/use-sensible-editor to unset VISUAL

quilt (0.48-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * The new algorithm that makes quilt lookup parent directories for
    .pc/.quilt_{patches,series} lead to the failure of test/setup.test
    when run in the Debian source package since $QUILT_PATCHES points
    to debian/patches when the test script expect it to be "patches".
    Avoid this by forcing QUILT_PATCHES in the test script (patch
    debian/patches/fix-test-setup) but suggest upstream to hardcode locations
    in quilt setup. Closes: #573689
  * Update Standards-Version to 3.8.4 (no changes needed).

    freshly untarred quiltified projects.

    it didn't came from the debian/rules and neither from the package
    Makefile, but from the makefile I use to rebuild the package here.
    Closes: #402114.

quilt (0.46-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Integrate the changes to the quilt package from Simon Horman.
    Add Simon to the uploaders list. Changes to the different patches:

    [arch_all] (modified)
      - stop exporting QUILT_LIB in bin/quilt since there is no lib after the
        arch_all modification
      - remove the backup-files.c since we don't use it anymore

    [mail-signature] (new)
      new option --signature to the mail command to specify which signature
      file to use (defaults to ~/.signature)

    [no-signature-test] (new)
      forbid the use of a .signature file in the tests (using the feature of
      previous patch) to not fail when a ~/.signature is present

    [mail-from-locale] (new)
      Force locale to C when generating date for From header

  * [debian/quilt.make]: various fixes
    - Do not indent internal comments or make will display them, and
      likewise for debian/patchsys-quilt.mk. (Closes: #418680)
      By Peter Eisentraut.
    - Add ".PHONY: patch unpatch" as it should be. (Closes: #405558)
      By Steinar H. Gunderson.
    - Place emacs mode on the first line. (Closes: #406249)
      By Marco Túlio Gontijo e Silva.

  * [debian/patchsys-quilt.mk] use $(CURDIR) instead of $(shell pwd)
    By Loïc Minier. (Closes: #406183)

  * [patches/doc_improvements] catch punctuation typos. (Closes: #402120)
    By Bastian Kleineidam.

  * [patches/makefile_gliches] Yet another try to remove debuging output
    form the makefile. By Bastian Kleineidam. (Closes: #402114)

  * Suggest the graphviz package since the graph command use it (at least
    the 'dot' command of graphviz). (Closes: #407469).
  * Change Build-deps into Build-dep-indep since we're now arch:all

quilt (0.45-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * [debian/patches/override_mail_sender_in_testsuite]
    Fix the patch to catch all occurences of 'quilt mail' since each of them
    will cause a FTBFS on misconfigured hosts (thanks to Goswin Brederlow).
    (Closes: #397285, #395482, #393985) I hope, at least.

quilt (0.45-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't even try to build the package when /proc is not mounted since
     the checks will fail after a long moment. #380598 is thus closed twice:
     once upstream with the changes from 0.45-2 and in debian now.
    Note that if nocheck is added to DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS, the package will be
     built since there will be no test to fail. The only pb is that I can't
     remember of how to add this option with dpkg-buildpackage ;)

    - Update all patches
  * Acknoledge the NMU. Thanks Vorlon. Closes: #364834.
  * Move cdbs & debhelper from Build-Depends-Indep to Build-Depends since it
    is what I understand from the Right Thing to do.
  * Pass --quiltrc /dev/null to quilt in /usr/share/quilt/quilt.make for
    those who don't use cdbs but still don't want to FTBFTS because of
    personal settings in ~/.quiltrc. Closes: #370041.

    pbuilds well here. Let's see what the buildd think of it.
    
  * Avoid infinite loops in backup-files when patching inexistant files.
    Thanks to Dan for reporting and sorting the problem out.
    (Closes: #366424).

    Adds test/file-not-found.test pushing a patch touching a inexistant
    file (yeah, that's the previous bug)

  * Make sure that quilt fails when trying to push a non existant patch (ie
    if there is a typo in the serie file) unless -f is provided.
    (Closes: #358875).
  * Let /etc/mailname override the hostname in the mail command

quilt (0.39-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. 
    0.38 were mostly bugfixes, and those bugs were also reported against
      debian package, so I had to steal most of the cvs content already.
    0.39 is also mainly bugfixes. There is a new "mail" command I didn't
      test yet. ;)
      
  * Refuse to add symlinks into patches since we fail to backup them
    properly. (Closes: #294424). Will be in 0.40 ;)
  * Take care of the lost souls patching their config.* files. 
    Cdbs updates them automatically. Thanks to Robert Millan for detecting
    the issue (in cdbs) and proposing a fix (in quilt). (Closes: #295913).
    
    This implies a versionned depend on cdbs (>=0.4.27-1) for using packages, 
    since part of the fix is in there. quilt itself suggests this version.
